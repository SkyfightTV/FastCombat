# FastCombat

    What is FastCombat ?

FastCombat is a plugin that allows you to kill players who disconnect during a fight and disable access to commands.

    How does it work ?

After placing it in the "plugins" folder of your server and restarting it. The plugin will automatically create a config.yml and a lang.yml file in your home folder.
After configuring and translating it, you can restart or reload your server , the plugin will take effect immediately.

I hope this plugin will be useful for you !

I am open to any request for modification of the plugin but also to contributions that can be made by you!
